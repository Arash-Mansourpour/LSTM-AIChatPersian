# LSTM-AIChatPersian
This project develops a Persian RAG chatbot using LSTM with attention, embedding, tokenization, Google API integration, and Redis for recall. Optimizers like Adam and RMSprop, along with regularization (L1, L2) and data augmentation, enhance the model. Performance is evaluated through BLEU, ROUGE, Self-Supervised Learning, and METEOR metrics.
